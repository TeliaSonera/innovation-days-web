                    <p class="answer">Do not worry! There will be other attendees with ideas, and we need people that can help develop the ideas. That can be you :-)</p>
                    <h2 class="question">Which prerequisites are needed?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">None, specifically. If you work in Telia Norway AS you already have what it takes. Your point of view is important and it can be used to develop great ideas.

                    <h2 class="question">I may have an idea but I am not sure if it is any good…</h2>
                    <p class="answer">First step, Dare! Do not let your doubts stop you from submitting your idea. Typically at these kind of events the idea you first introduce will at the course of the event changed, evolved and become better because you work in a team that has important and valid feedback. <br/><br/>
Second step: talk to a possible costumer or user of the idea. Feedback from actual users is invaluable! <br/><br/>

                    <h2 class="question">What ideas can I submit?</h2>
